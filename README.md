This simple bitcrusher plug-in is effective for adding crunch and drive to your mix.
Implementations include: 
Parallel compression with drums or kick.
As a unique audio processing tool.
Add a different flavour to guitar/bass tones.

I recommend using this plug-in with a limiter as the algorithm causes the channel to clip.
I implemented my own limiter within the code which stopped this clipping however I lost the tone from the plug in that I desired.

This limiter code is simply commented out so feel free to explore with the code.
